## What is it? ##

This application allows, with the appropriate hardware, control of your Mac through the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) protocol on the HDMI bus. More info on CEC [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control#CEC).

In plain English: Use your TV's remote control to control your Mac!

Very much a work in progress at the moment. More info soon.
